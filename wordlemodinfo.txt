The WordleInfo class contains 3 info types required in wordle. The green type is a list of 5 letters. This info represents the letters that are in the same position as the answer word. The yellow type is a dictionary. Each key is a letter and each value is a list containing an integer representing the number of times that letter occurs and a list of integer values representing indices where that letter cannot be. The black type is a list of letters which either do not exist in the answer or do not have any instances outside of ones already accounted for. These info types are accessed using .green, .yellow and .black, respectively.
